# Configuration

Here are the configuration options, set to the default values, for this service. If you are unsure about where this goes or what this means, we *highly recommend* scanning the [services documentation](https://docs.lando.dev/core/v3/services/lando.html) to get a good handle on how the magicks work.

Also note that options, in addition to the [build steps](https://docs.lando.dev/core/v3/services/lando.html#build-steps) and [overrides](https://docs.lando.dev/core/v3/services/lando.html#overrides) that are available to every service, are shown below:

```yaml
services:
  myservice:
    type: varnish:6
    backends:
      - appserver
    backend_port: 80
    ssl: false
    config:
      vcl: SEE BELOW
    overrides:
      environment: SEE BELOW
```

## Connecting to backend services

You will need to list the `http` backend services you want `varnish` to use. Note that the services in this list should be serving content on port `80`. They can be discovered by running [lando info](https://docs.lando.dev/cli/info.html).

An example of a Landofile's `services` config that connects to a `nginx` backend called `web1` is shown below:

```yaml
services:
  myservice:
    type: varnish
    backends:
      - web1
  web1:
    type: nginx
```

## Setting a port

While we assume your `varnish` service is running on port `80`, we recognize that many apps also run on other ports. You can easily change our default to match whatever your app needs. Note that this port applies to **ALL BACKENDS**.

```yaml
services:
  myservice:
    type: varnish
    backend_port: 8080
```

## Using SSL

In order to access varnish over `https`, you only need to set `ssl: true`. However, because [varnish is not built to run over https](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/09/https-everywhere-with-nginx-varnish-apache/), we will spin up an additional `nginx` container called `SERVICE_ssl` and handle SSL termination there.

## Using a custom VCL file

It's highly likely you will want to use your own [vcl](https://varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/users-guide/vcl.html) file to mimic the setup that you need to test against. You can do that by setting `config.vcl` as shown below:

**A hypothetical project**

Note that you can put your configuration files anywhere inside your application directory. We use a `config` directory but you can call it whatever you want such as `.lando` in the example below:

```bash
./
|-- config
   |-- custom.vcl
|-- .lando.yml
```

**Landofile's varnish config**

```yaml
services:
  myservice:
    type: varnish
    config:
      vcl: config/custom.vcl
```

## Advanced

There are also [several envvars](https://github.com/wodby/varnish) exposed by the underlying image we use that you can set to further customize how your Varnish works. **These are not officially supported** so we *highly recommend* you do not alter them unless you know what you are doing. Even then, YMMV.

That said, you will need to use a [service override](https://docs.lando.dev/core/v3/services/lando.html#overrides) to take advantage of them as shown below:

```yaml
myservice:
  type: varnish
  hosts:
    - database
  overrides:
    environment:
      VARNISH_STRIP_ALL_PARAMS: true
      VARNISHD_PARAM_FETCH_CHUNKSIZE:	16k
      VARNISHD_PARAM_FIRST_BYTE_TIMEOUT:	80
      VARNISHD_PARAM_GZIP_BUFFER:	32k
```

## Getting information

You can get connection and credential information about your varnish instance by running [`lando info`](https://docs.lando.dev/cli/info.html). It may also be worth checking out our [accessing services externally guide](https://docs.lando.dev/guides/external-access.html).
